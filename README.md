The idea of this project is to be able to create color palettes which will copy whatever color is picked to the users clipboard. The user can see a list of their palettes which contain miniaturized versions of the full palette to choose whichever they see fit. It also allows the user to create their own palette and save them to local storage. Every color in each palette shows the different shades for that specific color to choose from, and it is also possible to choose the formatting of the color before copying it (RGB, RGBA, Hex). 

The app was built using ReactJs, Material UI, Color picker library, among others and was one of my first experiences using hooks and transitions, as well as react memo for performance reasons. I chose to use local storage so that any user can give it a try without needing to download/install anything outside of what is in the repository. The app is also fully responsive and designed to be used on any device, though personally, I find copying things to clipboard on my computer much more useful.

Once the repository is downloaded you can use the comand nm install to install the dependencies, and npm start to start the app
